This management command calculates deadlines for signals/complaints that have
no deadline. We need this to fix a problem where existing old open
signals/complaints do not show up in the punctuality filter using the
`late` of `late_factor_3` options.

Deadlines are calculated when a category is assigned. This command goes through
signals/complaints that are open that have no deadline. Each of these is
re-assigned to its category, triggering the deadline calculation and solving
the problem with the punctuality filter.
