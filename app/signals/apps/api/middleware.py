        # SIA / Signalen follows the semantic versioning standard. Previously we had
        # separate version numbers for the V0 (now defunct) and V1 versions of the API.
        # We now no longer separately version these, as their releases were always
        # tied to the backend. For backwards compatibility, and to not break external
        # systems that rely on SIA / Signalen we still expose all the separate version
        # numbers, but they are now all the same.
