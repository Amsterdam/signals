# Versioning
# ==========
# SIA / Signalen follows the semantic versioning standard. Previously we had
# separate version numbers for the V0 (now defunct) and V1 versions of the API.
# We now no longer separately version these, as their releases were always
# tied to the backend. For backwards compatibility, and to not break external
# systems that rely on SIA / Signalen we still expose all the separate version
# numbers, but they are now all the same.


# Application version (Major, minor, patch)
VERSION = (2, 13, '0')
