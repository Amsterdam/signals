  title: Signalen Informatievoorziening Amsterdam (SIA) API spec V1"
  description: >-
    One of the tasks of the municipality of Amsterdam is to maintain
    public spaces like roads, parks. When citizens have complaints about public
    spaces they can leave these complaints with the municipality. SIA, the
    Signalen Informatievoorziening Amsterdam, receives these complaints and is
    used to track progress towards their resolution.


    SIA provides an API that is used both by the SIA frontend and external
    systems that integrate with SIA. This swagger file documents that API.
