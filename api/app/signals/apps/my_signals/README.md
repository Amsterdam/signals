# My Signals

_Currently, this app is in active development_  

The "my signals" app provides a way for reporters to get an overview of the signals they created over the last 12 months.

A reporter can request a login link that will be sent by email to the provided email address. This link is valid for X amount of time. The default is set to 2 hours and can be changed setting the `MY_SIGNALS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_SECONDS` env variable.

To request access to "my signals" the following flow must be followed:
* The reporter has received an email when he/she created a signal and left their email address
  * This email will contain a link to the "request access" page
* The reporter will "request access" with the email address they provided when creating a signal
* If over the last 12 months one or more signals have been created with this email address as the `Reporter.email` an email will be sent
  * This email will provide a token that can be set as a header to all other "My signals" calls, `Authorisation: Token { TOKEN }`
  * This link can be configured by setting the `MY_SIGNALS_URL` env variable
