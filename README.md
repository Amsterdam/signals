# Signalen

Signalen is a web application that allows citizens and interested parties to
report problems in public spaces, such as noise complaints or broken
streetlights, to the municipality. These signals (signalen in Dutch) are then
followed up on by the appropriate municipal services.

The associated web front-end code is available at [Amsterdam/signals-frontend](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals-frontend).

Signalen is based on a proof of concept ((https://github.com/Amsterdam/sia))
that previously ran on https://vaarwatermeldingen.amsterdam.nl/ and has
replaced MORA (Meldingen openbare ruimte Amsterdam).
