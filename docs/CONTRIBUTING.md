## Code Review

* Contributions will not be merged until they have been code reviewed by at least 1 other developer

* Contributions will not be merged if there are no test proving that the code works as intended

* Contributions will not be merged if there is no documentation provided

* You should implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it 

* In the event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply, you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution

## Code formatting

**Follow the style you see used in the repository**. Consistency with the project always outweigh other considerations. It doesnâ€™t matter if you have your own style - just follow along.

The Signals codebase uses the [PEP-8](https://pep8.org/) code style in general.
In addition to the standards outlined in PEP 8, we have a few guidelines:

* Line-length can exceed 79 characters, to 120, when convenient.
* Line-length can exceed 120 characters, when doing otherwise would be terribly inconvenient.
* Always use single-quoted strings (e.g. 'some string used as an example'), unless a single-quote occurs within the string (e.g. "don't use single quotes for these kind of strings").
