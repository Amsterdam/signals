# Connecting to the API

## Local development

The Docker Compose file provides [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) as Identity  Provider.

Start Dex with the following command:

```console
docker-compose up -d dex
```

The data of Dex is persisted on a [named volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). The following user is created:

- E-mail: signals.admin@example.com
- Password: password

Request an access token through the following URL: `http://localhost:5556/auth?response_type=id_token&scope=openid+email+profile&client_id=signals&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3001/manage/incidents&nonce=random-nonce`

After login is completed, copy `access_token` from the URL you are redirected to. You can use this token to make calls to the API.

Make sure you assign superuser permissions to the default user with:

```console
docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py createsuperuser --username signals.admin@example.com --email signals.admin@example.com
```
