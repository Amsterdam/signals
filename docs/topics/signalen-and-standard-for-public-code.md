# Signalen and the Standard for Public Code

This document describes the progress of implementing [The Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/). The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by similar public organizations in other places.

## [Code in the Open](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/code-in-the-open.html)

- [ ] compliant with this criterion.

Requirement | meets | links and notes
-----|-----|-----
All source code for any policy and software in use (unless used for fraud detection) MUST be published and publicly accessible. | yes? | What policy is Signalen based upon? Lacks public dataset for easily running the machine learning model.
Contributors MUST NOT upload sensitive information regarding users, their organization or third parties to the repository.  | yes |
Any source code not currently in use (such as new versions, proposals or older versions) SHOULD be published. | yes | Git history and tags per release. Backend is currently starting to publish tags again.
The source code MAY provide the general public with insight into which source code or policy underpins any specific interaction they have with an organization. |  |

## [Bundle policy and source code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/bundle-policy-and-code.html)

- [ ] compliant with this criterion.

Requirement | meets | links and notes
-----|-----|-----
A codebase MUST include the policy that the source code is based on. |  |
A codebase MUST include all source code that the policy is based on. |  |
All policy and source code that the codebase is based on MUST be documented, reusable and portable. |  |
Policy SHOULD be provided in machine readable and unambiguous formats. |  |
Continuous integration tests SHOULD validate that the source code and the policy are executed coherently. |  |

## [Create reusable and portable code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/reusable-and-portable-codebases.html)

- [ ] compliant with this criterion.

Requirement | meets | links and notes
-----|-----|-----
The codebase MUST be developed to be reusable in different contexts. | yes |

- [ ] compliant with this criterion.

Requirement | meets | links and notes
-----|-----|-----
The codebase MUST allow anyone to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase. | yes |
The codebase MUST include contribution guidelines explaining what kinds of contributions are welcome and how contributors can get involved, for example in a CONTRIBUTING file. | yes |
The codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organizations in the development and maintenance. | (maybe) | The signalen.org website shows the logos.
The codebase SHOULD document the governance of the codebase, contributions and its community, for example in a GOVERNANCE file. | no |

Reviewers MUST provide feedback on all decisions to not accept a contribution. | yes | Weekly dev call for discussion.
Contributions SHOULD conform to the standards, architecture and decisions set out in the codebase in order to pass review. | yes | Architecture docs for both frontend and backend, might be nice to have a checkbox in a PR template.
Reviews SHOULD include running both the code and the tests of the codebase. | yes |
Contributions SHOULD be reviewed by someone in a different context than the contributor. | some | VNG pull requests all reviewed by Amsterdam, frontend & backend cross-review rare, Amsterdam pull requests often not cross-reviewed by VNG. PO acceptance testing is part of review, but during acceptance.
Version control systems SHOULD not accept non-reviewed contributions in release versions. | yes | Sometimes the "Github administrator" override is used when no reviewer is available.

The documentation of the codebase MUST contain: a description of how to install and run the source code, examples demonstrating the key functionality. |  | There are no docs for system administrators. There is documentation on [helm-charts](https://github.com/Signalen/helm-charts), and developer documentation for [frontend](https://github.com/Signalen/frontend/blob/develop/README.md) and [backend](https://github.com/Signalen/backend/blob/master/README.md).
The documentation of the codebase SHOULD contain: a high level description that is clearly understandable for a wide audience of stakeholders, like the general public and journalists, a section describing how to install and run a standalone version of the source code, including, if necessary, a test dataset, examples for all functionality. | yes | Signalen.org website.
There SHOULD be continuous integration tests for the quality of the documentation. | no | Link-checker does not check external links. Markdown in code repositories is not automatically checked.

Requirement | meets | links and notes
-----|-----|-----
Contributions MUST adhere to either a coding or writing style guide, either the codebase community’s own or an existing one that is advertised in or part of the codebase. | yes | CI fails when not adhering to code styles.
